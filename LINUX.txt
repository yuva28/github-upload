pwd command prints the working directory, your current location within the filesystem
cd (change directory) command to change directories.

cd [options] [path]
To move to the root directory, use the / character as the argument to the cd command.

o/p:
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cd /
sysadmin@localhost:/$

Relative paths do not start with the / character, they start with the name of a directory.
eg:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Documents                                              
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$
